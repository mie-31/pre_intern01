        <p style="color: brown;font-size: 18px;">The personal and the autobiographical: The essayists that feel most comfortable in this pole "write fragments of reflective autobiography and look at the world through the keyhole of anecdote and description".</p>
        <p style="color: rgb(127, 209, 127);font-style: bold;">The abstract-universal: In this pole "we find those essayists who do their work in the world of high abstractions", who are never personal and who seldom mention the particular facts of experience.</p>
